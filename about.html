            <p class="presentation__main__text">I am Karina Romano Perozzo, a Brazilian based in England. I am married and a mother of a handsome boy and three little angels. I am also a dog lover and have two Shih Tzus as members of our family. I am passionate about sports, especially racquet sports like tennis, table tennis, squash, badminton, and beach tennis, and I cannot wait to try paddle.</p>
            <p class="presentation__main__text">Finding solutions to problems best describes me as a professional. I have had to reinvent myself several times, and now at 43 years old, I am at a stage in life where I am starting from scratch and learning coding. I will be using this platform to share my journey with you. </p>
